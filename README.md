# Walmart - Confidence Interval and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Project 📈🛒

Welcome to the Walmart Confidence Interval and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) project! 🚀 In this project, we'll delve into customer purchase patterns at Walmart during Black Friday, utilizing data analysis to empower Walmart with actionable insights. 📊

## About Walmart 🌎🛍

Walmart stands as one of the largest retail corporations globally, serving over 100 million customers through its expansive network of supercenters, discount stores, and grocery shops across the United States. 🌐

## The Business Challenge 📝🤔

The Walmart management team aims to gain a deeper understanding of customer purchase behaviors, particularly analyzing the relationship between purchase amounts and factors such as gender, age, and occupation. They are curious about questions like: "Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?" Imagine a scenario with 50 million male and 50 million female customers—what insights can we uncover about their spending habits? 🛒💰

## The Dataset 📦📊

The dataset includes the following features:

* **User_ID:** Unique identifier for each user
* **Product_ID:** Unique identifier for each product
* **Gender:** Gender of the user
* **Age:** Age categorized into bins
* **Occupation:** Masked occupation identifier
* **City_Category:** Classification of the city (A, B, C)
* **StayInCurrentCityYears:** Number of years the user has stayed in the current city
* **Marital_Status:** Marital status of the user
* **ProductCategory:** Masked category of the product
* **Purchase:** Purchase amount

## What Success Looks Like 👍📈

To address this business challenge, we'll embark on an analytical journey involving the following steps:

1. **Data Import & Exploration:** Begin by importing the dataset and performing initial analyses to understand its structure and characteristics.

2. **Handling Null Values & Outliers:** Identify and address any null values and outliers using techniques like boxplots, the `describe` method, and `isnull` checks.

3. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the spending behavior by tracking the average amount spent per transaction among 50 million female and 50 million male customers. Calculate averages and draw meaningful conclusions.

4. **Confidence Interval Calculation:** Utilize sample averages to compute a Confidence Interval (CI) for the population's average spending. This is where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) plays a crucial role!

5. **Experiment with CI Width:** Explore various CI widths (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%) and document your observations.

6. **Conclusions and Recommendations:** Summarize your findings and check whether the confidence intervals for average spending among male and female customers overlap. Provide insights on how Walmart can use this data to make informed decisions.

7. **Extended Analysis:** Replicate the analysis to explore spending behaviors among different marital statuses and age groups, uncovering further insights.

8. **Actionable Insights for Walmart:** Offer recommendations and actionable items based on your findings, helping Walmart enhance the shopping experience for its customers. 🤝💼

# 🎯 **Targeted Sales and Marketing Recommendations for Walmart**

## 💳 **Gender-Based Offers**
- **Balanced Offers for Male and Female Customers**: Male customers have higher purchasing amounts than female customers. Walmart can focus on giving special offers to both genders to retain male customers while also increasing the purchasing amounts of female customers.

## 🧑‍🎓 **Age Group Promotions**
- **Student Discounts for Younger Age Groups**: The age group between 26-35 spends more money than others. To increase purchasing amounts in other age groups, Walmart can offer student discounts to those aged 0-17 and 18-25.

## 👩‍❤️‍👨 **Campaigns for Married Couples**
- **Family-Oriented Campaigns**: There are more unmarried customers than married ones. Walmart can create campaigns targeting married couples, offering deals on home appliances, children’s products, and rewards for family-related purchases.

## 📉 **Boosting Low-Performing Categories**
- **Discounts on Categories 19 and 20**: Categories 19 and 20 have lower sales and are mostly bought by men. To boost sales, Walmart could lower the prices of these categories during Black Friday week.

## 💳 **Encouraging Credit Card Usage**
- **Target Occupation Category 8**: The occupation category 8 has significantly lower purchase amounts compared to others. Walmart can encourage these customers to use credit cards during Black Friday week by offering additional discounts for card payments.

## 💸 **City-Specific Cashback Rewards**
- **Incentives for Male Customers**: In all city categories, males have higher purchase amounts. To further boost sales, Walmart can offer additional cashback rewards to male customers in city categories B, C, and A.

## 🎯 **Loyalty Discounts**
- **Target Long-Term Residents**: Both male and female customers who have stayed one year in the city have the highest purchasing amounts. Walmart can offer them a 50% discount during Black Friday week as a loyalty reward.

## 💳 **Promoting Credit Card Usage**
- **Black Friday Cashback Offers**: Walmart can promote credit card usage during Black Friday week by offering cashback incentives or additional discounts. This strategy can increase sales across both genders.
